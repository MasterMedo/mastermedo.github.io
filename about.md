Hi, I'm Mislav, a software engineer from Croatia.
I build streaming graph applications at [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/), a startup in my home town of Zagreb, where I spend most of my days.
In my free time I code terminal clients, build websites, attend coding competitions and solve math puzzles.

Apart from coding, I hit the gym every day, run fifty kilometres a week, and hike at least twice a month.
For the last two years I've been playing a bunch of board games; Nidavellir and Root are my favourites.
Usually, I'm alone on my quests but every now and then a brave soul joins the fun.
If you're interested in any activity mentioned above don't hesitate to reach out.
