<h2>Hi, I'm Mislav.</h2>

I build streaming graph applications at [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com), a startup in my home town of Zagreb, where I spend most of my days.
Our team focuses on expanding the company through [growth hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking).
I fill the role of the software engineering portion of the team.
In my free time I code terminal clients, build websites, attend coding competitions and solve math puzzles.
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is my favourite competition, I went as far as completing every puzzle of each year for a total of 300 puzzles, and was within top 250 to do it.

I enjoy waking up early, if I'm not up by 6 am; hell has probably gone cold.
I hit the gym every day, run fifty kilometres a week, and hike at least twice a month.
Physical activities help me break mental barriers and keep me focused on my goals.
For the past two years I started practising playing board games with people I meet, I highly recommend [Unlock!](https://www.spacecowboys.fr/unlock-english), [Nidavellir](https://www.grrre-games.com/nidavellir) and [Root](https://ledergames.com/products/root-a-game-of-woodland-might-and-right).
Usually, I'm alone in my quests, but every now and then a brave soul joins the fun.
If you're interested in any activity mentioned above don't hesitate to reach out.
