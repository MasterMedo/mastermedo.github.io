I'm Mislav. I grew up in Croatia, and I live in Zurich, Switzerland. I'm focused on making Google internal server production infrastructure API-first.

<!-- In my free time I code terminal clients, build websites, attend coding competitions and solve math puzzles. -->
<!-- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is my favourite competition, I went as far as completing every puzzle of each year for a total of 300 puzzles, and was within first 250 developers to do it. -->

<!-- I enjoy waking up early, if I'm not up by 6 am; hell has probably gone cold. -->
<!-- I hit the gym every day, run fifty kilometres a week, and hike at least twice a month. -->
<!-- Physical activities help me break mental barriers and keep me focused on my goals. -->
<!-- For the past two years I started practising playing board games with the people I meet, I highly recommend [Unlock!](https://www.spacecowboys.fr/unlock-english), [Nidavellir](https://www.grrre-games.com/nidavellir) and [Root](https://ledergames.com/products/root-a-game-of-woodland-might-and-right). -->
<!-- If you're interested in any activity mentioned above don't hesitate to reach out. -->
