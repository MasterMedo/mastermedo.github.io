A loud thump echoed, followed by a splash.
A small head peeped above the large white pile and gazed upon the sky as the snow started to fall.
The cute despise in the half closed, squinted eyes of a victim that just got hit by a snowball.
Howling wind and whizzing ice balls causing fire on our cheeks.
Running back and forth, making forts --- just having fun.
I look forward to our Christmases.
