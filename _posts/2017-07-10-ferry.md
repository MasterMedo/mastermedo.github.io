Standing in the shade, I watched the ferry sail into the harbour.
The sun was not at the zenith yet, but it was already piping hot.
I was leaned against a wall, waiting for the crowd to clear out.
You were nowhere to be seen, but the burst of emotions was already overflowing me as the ferry stopped moving.
I felt like I couldn't wait a single moment more.
The instant the ferry opened it's doors I raised myself on my toes in hopes of seeing you that much quicker.
I even raised my hand high up so you could spot me easier.
As I was moving my head from left to right the time suddenly stopped.
There you were.
With a smile almost as wide as the eyes that were trying to spot me.

The moment went on and I found myself walking to you through the crowd.
Half way through, someone ran into me and hugged me harder than any girl could.
Or so I thought.
That was your smell alright.
I lifted you up, there, in the middle of the crowd.

-- I missed you -- I muttered ready to put you down.
You just let out a faint sigh and hugged me even harder.
After a long minute we finally let go.
When our eyes locked, we gazed at each other trying to make up for the time spent apart.
You leaned in for a kiss whispering -- I missed you more.
