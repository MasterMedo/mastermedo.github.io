Standing in the shade, I watched the ferry glide into the harbour.
The sun was not at the zenith yet, but the heat was already stifling.
I leaned against the wall, waiting for the crowd to clear out.
You were nowhere to be seen, but the burst of emotions was already engulfing me as the ferry slowed to a stop.
I couldn't wait a moment longer.

The instant the doors creaked open, I raised myself on my toes in hopes of seeing you that much quicker.
I even raised my hand high up so you could spot me easier.
As I scanned the faces my gaze stopped and the time froze.
There you were.
With a smile almost as wide as the eyes that were trying to spot me.

The moment went on and I found myself walking to you through the crowd as I lost sight of you.
Half way there, someone crashed into me and hugged me tighter than any girl could.
Or so I thought.
That was your smell, alright.
I lifted you up, right there in the middle of the crowd.

I missed you -- I muttered ready to put you down.
You just let out a faint sigh and hugged me even tighter.
After a long minute we finally let go.
When our eyes locked, we gazed at each other trying to make up for the time spent apart.
You leaned in for a kiss whispering -- I missed you more.
