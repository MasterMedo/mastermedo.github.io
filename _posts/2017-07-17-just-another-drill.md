Last night a war broke out in my country.
Screams filled the night with terror.
Someone misissued an order to launch missiles on our own land.

The general, who initially took the blame on himself, got thrown in jail together with the person who launched the missiles within an hour of the happening.
Both of them claimed to have no idea what went down.

The general read his order back a million times over in his head trying to comprehend what he might have said wrong.
He was mortified with what had happened but had no clue why or how things went south.

Sally, from the moment of launching the missiles had no doubts about the general.
She proceeded carrying out all orders that were given to her, as she usually does, without questioning them.
There have been many drills over the years where nothing happened when she pressed the red button, and yesterday, was no different.
She must have thought to herself â€“- Just another drill...

Three days after the event it was determined around 5,000 people lost their lives and more than 11,000 were severely injured.
This was no small mistake.
The investigation confirmed there was no machine malfunction.

After the trial both were deemed: "Not guilty."
