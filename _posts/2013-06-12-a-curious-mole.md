Thrumming of the tires on the white pathway threaded the silence in cadence with the valve stem pattering on the bicycle fork.
I was turning those black pedals following Her through the greenery while the wind kissed my cheeks.
We rode slower than usual.
A short wooden bridge before the long mowed down field.
Just as I thought we'd pass it by, She playfully turned towards me, checking if I'm following Her, and turned straight to the green grass slowing down in the middle of the meadow.
The sun burst with pleasure knowing two cyclists are stopping to enjoy it's warm rays.
She slowly dismounted the bike and gently set it aside by a mole hill protruding from the ground.
She was smiling, eyes wide open, patiently waiting for me to walk up to Her.

-- Are you thirsty? -- I asked as I was taking the water from the bike bottle cage.
Her smile widened -- Thank you, young man -- she answered shaking Her head.
We sat on the dewy grass facing each other.
The suppressed purl of the stream, birds chirping, the rhythmical rattling of the still-spinning front wheel of my bicycle and her long mellifluous breathing.
She leaned back on her hands and looked up to the skies as I started playing with the leaves of a dandelion.
Every leaf is different, I thought to myself, and started imagining a scene a few meters away;

We and our copies next to us, alone on the whole meadow.
While we're resting on the ground they are strolling beside us.\
-- Hmph -- he grinned.\
-- What is it? -- she asked in surprise stopping in her tracks and turning towards him.\
He was looking at the dandelion leaf in his right hand.\
-- We're all striving to achieve more in life -- he started, playing with the words -- One small leaf is very interesting but only until the hand stumbles upon something better and lets go of the leaf. --\
I understood what he was trying to do.
My eyes lit up, and my look became unbearably curious.
I was eager to see how will he pull it off.
He felt the wind on his back and tried to determine the direction it was blowing in as he let go of the leaf knowing it would fly towards her.
Pretending to be catching the leaf he leaned towards her and placed left his hand on her hip.
Her faint laughter gently echoed the field now looking at his hand.\
His confidence and imagination grew and he continued -- But when a warm hand stumbles upon a flower which is -- he paused for a second, carefully choosing his words -- blushing. -- he added, clumsily, laughing at himself.\
He took a half step towards her connecting his toes with hers as he started running his fingertips up her back revealing her skin.
Her lustful look jumped to his lips as he continued.\
-- From the first touch the petals intertwine with the fingers and become inseparable. --\
A sudden jolt passed through his body as she grabbed his left hand with her right and put her other one on his chest leaning onto him.\
I was glowing with unbearable anticipation, probably being as interesting of a sight as the one I was following.
I knew She was watching me, that little curious head.
The play paused and I wanted to send Her a warm smile but I just couldn't take my eyes off the love birds.

-- What are you looking at? -- She mumbled curiously.\
I kept silent for a moment making sure the scene won't continue.
I tilted my head and almost mysteriously whispered -- the two of us. --\
-- ... -- She moved her eyes to the left and back as she continued -- and, what are we doing *this time*? --\
I loved teasing Her with different stories.\
-- I'm stroking your right knee with mine and telling one of my stories. -- I said raising the atmosphere by the word.
She smiled as she leaned forward into a sitting position placing her hands on the wet grass in front of her.\
-- And what am I doing? -- She provoked.\
I glanced to the frozen figures reminding myself.
-- Your warm breath is kissing my lips. Your hand is on my chest and your breath is getting warmer as you're getting closer. -- I was barely keeping a straight face.\
She shifted from a kneeling position onto all fours transferring her weight to her hands watching me eagerly.
I responded with a smile suspecting what She'll do next.
She came closer cheekily, set her hand on my chest and pushed me onto the soft ground.
Then She found herself above me like a tiger above it's pray and She pressed her warm lips against my ear and innocently whispered\
-- Like this? --\
What is a crazy story without a white lie, I thought to myself.
I raised my right knee between her legs, lifted her shirt caressing her back with my nails and lifted myself off the ground almost touching her lips\
-- Exactly like this -- I mumbled connecting our eyelashes, while our lips, already thirsty for others, melted together.
