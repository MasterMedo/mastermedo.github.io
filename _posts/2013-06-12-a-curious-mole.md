Thrumming of the tires on the white pathway threaded the silence in cadence with the valve stem pattering on the bicycle fork.
I turned the black pedals, chasing Her through the greenery while the wind brushed my cheeks.
We rode slower than usual.
A short wooden bridge before the long mowed down field.
Just as I thought we'd pass it by, She glanced over Her shoulder, checking if I'm following Her, and veered off the path, slowing down in the middle of the meadow.
The sun burst with pleasure knowing two cyclists are stopping to enjoy its warm rays.
She dismounted Her bike and gently set it by a mole hill protruding from the ground.
Her smile widened as She waited for me to catch up.

"Are you thirsty?" I asked, pulling the bottle from my bike's cage.
"Thank you, young man," She replied, shaking Her head.
We sat on the dewy grass, facing each other.
I closed my eyes and let myself be immersed in the surroundings.
The suppressed purl of the stream, birds chirping, the rhythmical rattling of the still-spinning front wheel of my bicycle and Her long mellifluous breathing.
She leaned back on Her hands and gazed at the sky as I started playing with the leaves of a dandelion.
Every leaf is different, I thought to myself, and started imagining a scene a few meters away;

We and our copies next to us, alone on the whole meadow.
While we're resting on the ground they are strolling beside us.\
"Hmph" he grinned.\
"What is it?" she asked in surprise, stopping in her tracks and turning towards him.\
He was looking at the dandelion leaf in his right hand.\
"We all strive for more" he began,\
"One leaf is interesting, but only until the hand stumbles upon something better -- and lets it go."\
I understood what he was trying to do.
My eyes lit up, and my look became unbearably curious.
I was eager to see how he will pull it off.
He felt the wind at his back, released the leaf, and watched it drift toward her.
Pretending to be catching the leaf he leaned towards her and placed his hand on her hip.
Her faint laughter gently echoed the field as she looked at his hand.\
His confidence and imagination grew as he continued "But when a warm hand stumbles upon a flower that is..." he paused for a second, carefully choosing his words "...blushing." he added, clumsily, laughing at himself.\
He took a half step towards her connecting his toes with hers as he started gliding his fingertips up her back revealing her skin.
Her lustful look jumped to his lips as he continued.\
"From the first touch the petals intertwine with the fingers and become inseparable."\
A sudden jolt passed through his body as she embraced his left hand with her right and put her other on his chest leaning onto him.\
I was glowing with unbearable anticipation, probably being as interesting of a sight as the one I was following.
I knew She was watching me, Her curious head tilted.
The play paused, but I didn't take my eyes off them out of fear they'd disappear.

"What are you looking at?" She asked.\
I kept silent for a moment making sure the scene won't continue.
I tilted my head and almost mysteriously whispered "The two of us."\
She gazed from left to right across the meadow "And what are we doing *this time*?"\
I teased "I'm stroking your right knee with mine, telling you another story."
She smiled as She leaned forward, placing Her hands on the wet grass in front of Her.\
"And what am I doing?" She pressed.\
I glanced to the frozen figures to remind myself.
"You're so close I can feel your breath. Your hand is on my chest and your lips..."
Before I could finish, She leaned forward onto all fours, set Her hand on my chest and pushed me gently to the ground.
Hovering like a tiger over its prey, She leaned closer, Her lips brushing my ear, "Like this?"\
I raised my knee between Her legs, lifted the back of Her shirt with one hand and lifted myself off the ground with the other until our lips barely touched.\
"Exactly like this" I whispered, as the meadow blurred, and our worlds united.
