Last night a war broke out in my country.
Screams filled the darkness with terror.
Someone misissued a launch order on our own land.

The general got thrown in jail together with the second-in-command within an hour of the happening.
Both claimed to have caused the accident by initiating the sequence.

The general read the order back a million times over in his head trying to comprehend what he might have misunderstood.
He was mortified with what had happened but had no clue how or why.

Sally, had no doubts about the general.
She carried out all orders given to her, verifying the authenticity of the issuer.
There have been many drills over the years when nothing happened when she turned the key, and yesterday was no different.
She must have thought to herself â€“- Just another drill...

Three days after the event, it was determined around 5,000 people lost their lives and more than 11,000 were severely injured.
This was no small mistake.
The investigation confirmed there was no machine malfunction.

After the trial both were deemed: "Not guilty."
