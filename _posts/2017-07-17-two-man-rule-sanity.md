Last night a war broke out in my country.
Screams filled the darkness with terror.
Someone misissued a launch order -- on our own land.

Within an hour, the general got thrown in jail, the second-in-command beside him.
Both swore they initiated the sequence, both took the blame.

The general read the order back a million times over in his head.
He was mortified with what had happened but had no clue how or why.

Sally, had no doubts.
The general's orders were clear.
Years of drills had dulled the fear,
When she turned the key, she expected nothing would happen.
She must have thought â€“- Just another drill...

Three days later, it was determined around 5,000 people lost their lives and more than 11,000 were severely injured.
A mistake too catastrophic for words.
The investigation confirmed-- no machine malfunctioned, no ghosts in the system.
Just human hands, and the trust placed in them.

After the trial both were deemed: "Not guilty."
